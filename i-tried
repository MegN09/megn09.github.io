    <h1>I Tried</h1>
<p>but my patience<br>
   like everyone else's'<br>
   is finite.<br>
   Sooner or later<br>
   my pent-up anger<br>
   would burst out of me.<br>
   But no matter how<br>
   many times I’d tell<br>
   myself that, there was<br>
   still the Voice in my<br>
   head, whispering to me,<br>
   <em>Try, try with all your might,<br>
   We’ll see if you don’t get in a fight.<br>
   And boy, was it right.<br>
   I tried<br>
   but I failed. Fell for bait. Blew up when I’d said I’d changed.<br>
   I tried<br>
   but the temptation was irresistible. Anger’s a drug, the very worst in existence.<br>
   I tried anyways.<br>
   The Voice could SCREAM but I refused to listen, drowning it out with positivity.<br>
   The worst had come and things could only get better.<br><br>
