     <h1>Things We'll Never Know</h1>
 <p>I don’t wanna kneel down<br>
    Don’t wanna pray<br>
    ‘Cause<br>
    What if we’re lying to ourselves<br>
    When we believe Hell exists?<br>
    Are we just pretending<br>
    When we say Heaven truly exists?<br>
    Guess some things, we'll never know<br></p>


<p>What happens when we die?<br>
What if religion’s just a lie?<br>
Maybe I wanna find out<br>
But I know it’s too soon<br>
Are we damned if we swear?<br>
Does God really care?<br>
Wish I could just let it go<br>
There’s some things we’ll never know<br></p>


<p>I wanna know<br>
If we’re just deluding ourselves<br>
When we believe in God?<br>
Is false hope better than none?<br>
To suppose it’s so or to scoff?<br>
Guess some things, I’ll never know<br></p>


<p>What happens when we die?<br>
What if religion’s just a lie?<br>
Kinda wanna find out<br>
But I know it’s too soon<br>
Are we damned if we swear?<br>
Does God really care?<br>
Wish I could just let it go<br>
Guess some things we’ll never know<br>
Never know, oh<br><br>
